# Observable Trends 

The first trend that jumps out isn't a surprising one, but most players of Pymoli are male.

The largest age group of players is generally in the college range, at 20-24 years old.

It follows along that the bulk of in-game purchases are made by this group, as well.

Most marketing efforts for the game should, therefore, focus on college-aged males.


Interestingly, though, females and Other/Non-Disclosed tend to spend more per person, so those groups shouldn't be ignored.  They actually result in more bang for the buck in terms of in-game purchases.
